== TODO ==

* If svnchangelog is called as "svntoday", only list log entries for the last 24 hours
* A filename can be given with -f (or a filename without -f and -n and -10 for the number)
* Rewrite/fix the nickToNameAndEmailWithUrl function


== DONE ==

* If a bullet point is one line, then a blank line, then a line again, remove the blank line
* Reverse the order of log entries under the headline of a certain date.
* Figure out nicks based on first letter of first name + ascii version of last name
