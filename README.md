A utility for generating a ChangeLog based on the last N elements in
the svn log.

Tailored specifically for use on Arch Linux package repositories.

Currently compiles with gccgo, but not with the latest version of Go, since the html package was removed.


TODO
====
* Rewrite so that it compiles with the latest version of Go
